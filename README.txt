Changelog:

v1.5.0-beta, August 03, 2010
- Renamed format to extractHash. This change may break backwards compatibility in advanced cases.
- Added support for anchors. This now requires a call to [var Action = this; this.documentReady()] once the content has updated to inform Ajaxy that it can take care of anchors now. See the updated JavaScript in the demo for more information. To do this we have included Ariel Flesler's $.fn.scrollTo with Balupton's $.fn.ScrollTo extension.
- Added auto_ajaxify_documentReady option
- Added auto_sparkle_documentReady option
- Removed dependency on JSON2, instead we use jQuery's parseJSON
- Fixed track providing 3 slashes issue
- Fixed redirect issue
- History requirement is now bundled into built jQuery Ajaxy script, so no need to include both anymore. This saves space as History and Ajax share some dependencies.
- Updated jQuery History dependencies to [v1.4.0-beta, August 03, 2010]
- This release may be a final release if no bugs are found.

v1.4.0-beta, August 01, 2010
- Updated licensing information. Still using the same license, as it is the best there is, but just provided some more information on it to make life simpler.
- A very large redo and IS NOT backwards compatible
- Added Controller.matches feature
- Changed naming convention to Google's Javascript Standards for everything but options
- Added #current to demo, to be similar to the jQuery History demo
- Fixed SEO in the demo by using [./] on the pages instead of [/]
- Added support for relative Ajaxy links
- The Controller, State and Action are now separate entities. Instead of doing [this.response_data] or [this.data.response] you now do [this.State.Response.data]
- All references to Hash have been renamed to State appropriately
- We now support loading in complete HTML documents. Will find content and title automatically.
- Updated jQuery Sparkle dependencies to [v1.4.8-beta, August 01, 2010]
- Updated jQuery History dependencies to [v1.3.0-beta, August 01, 2010]
- Quite close to a final release
